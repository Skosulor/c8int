* c8int
A chip-8 interpreter written in C. 

Requires SDL2 and CMake.

**** To compile and run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./c8int ROM_FILE
#+END_SRC

In "test" there is a test ROM which test most of the chip8's instructions.

**** Flags:
       - -h [pixels] : horizontal window size (integer)
       - -w [pixels] : vertical window size (integer)
       - -hz [frequency] : op code execution frequency (integer)
         
Default op code execution frequency is 714 Hz. Default resolution is 800X400

**** Example running  c8int with pong rom at 2000 Hz and resolution 1920X1080
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./c8int roms/pong -hz 2000 -w 1920 -h 1080
#+END_SRC
